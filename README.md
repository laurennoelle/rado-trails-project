# Project 4 "Rado Trails: Web App for Colorado hikers" 

Rado Trails is a web application designed to showcase various hiking trails located in Colorado, USA. This app allows the user to browse a list of trails, add reviews and ratings and create new trails. The frontend was built with React.js and the backend was built using a Rails API.

Created by Lauren Erxleben at Flatiron School

## MVP
As a user, I can:
* Log into the site
* View a list of all available trails in my area, their reviews, and star ratings
* Create a review for one specific trail
* Modify or delete a review that I made
* Create a new hiking trail listing

Stretch: As a user, I can:
* Upload files (pictures) to add to established trails 
* View trails on a map
* Search trails based on their distance from my location
* Filter trails based on highest rating

## Goals

My goal is to build a full-stack application with a powerful backend framework and simulate a professional work environment:

* Plan out my wireframes, features, models and relationships
* Pitch my app in a project proposal
* Use Git/Github for my source control system to track code changes 
* Build a React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) actions for my resource
* Utilize UI for my CSS styling
* Have several client-side routes using React router that implements a nav bar that allows user interaction
* Implement authentication, authorization and password protection that allows a user to log into the site and stay logged in via user ID in the session hash.

## Expected Accomplishments 

* organize our code into purposeful components in order to keep it clean and dry
* incorporate a UI framework for our styling with [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) or [Material UI](https://mui.com/)


## Frontend Setup
Fork and clone [our frontend repository] onto your local environment:  
In the project directory, install the dependencies by running:  
`npm install`  

In the project directory, you can run:  
`npm start`  
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.  


Fork and clone [our backend repository] onto your local environment:  
Install the dependencies by running:  
`npm install`  

To run your server in development mode, run:  
`npm run dev`  
While running in development mode, the server will re-load any time you make changes to the db.json file, so you can test our your seed data.  

While your server is running, you can make requests to http://localhost:3000. Check it out in the browser to make sure your server works!
